Amdahl's Law says that the parallelized algorithm Par can achieve a maximum speed-up over Seq of:;\(\frac{1}{s} \text{ for } p \rightarrow \infty\) where s is a strictly sequential fraction \(0 < s \le 1\), independent of n, that cannot be parallelized at all, and \(r = 1 - s\) that can be perfectly parallelized;performance objectives Amdahl speed-up
In a good parallel algorithm, not falling victim to Amdahl’s Law, the sequential part s(n) will:;not be a constant fraction of the total work, but depend on, and decrease with n. (Amdahl’s Law does not apply. A good speed-up can be achieved with large enough inputs.);performance objectives Amdahl speed-up
