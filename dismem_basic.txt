Name three properties of a distributed memory system \(\textbf{network}\) that play a decisive role for the performance of algorithms and programs:;<ul><li>speed of connections</li><li> processing capabilities</li><li>the structure (and composition) of the network</li></ul>;distributed_memory_systems network performance
An interconnect where the processors are also the communication elements, and in which there are no switches, is called:;A direct network.;distributed_memory_systems network interconnection direct_network
An interconnect, in which there are also special switch elements (special communication processors with connections to other elements) is called:;An indirect network.;distributed_memory_systems interconnection network inderect_network
The \(\textbf{diameter}\) of a (network) graph is defined as:;the maximum distance (number of links that have to be traversed) over all shortest paths between pairs of nodes (V). \[diam(G) = max\{dist(u,v)|u,v \in V\}\];distributed_memory_systems network graph diameter
The \(\textbf{degree}\) degree(G) of a graph G = (V,E) is defined as:;the largest number of outgoing edges from a node in G.;distributed_memory_systems network graph degree
The \(\textbf{bisection}\) width of a graph G = (V,E) is defined as:;the minimum number of edges that must be removed in order for the graph to fall apart into two approximately equally large parts.;distributed_memory_systems graph network bisection_width
What is a significant advantage of linear arrays and rings?;That they have the smallest possible number of links (to keep the graph connected) and very low degree.;distributed_memory_systems graph network degree
What is the difference between a torus and a mesh network?;A torus network is a mesh network with additional “wrap-around” edges between processors at the “borders” of the mesh.;distributed_memory_systems network graph
